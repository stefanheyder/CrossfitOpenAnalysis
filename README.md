# Crossfit Open 2019

This repository contains my analysis of the [Crossfit Open in the year 2019](https://games.crossfit.com/open). 


# Data

You can download the data yourself using `make download_data` and clean it (e.g. extract the interesting information) using `make clean_data`.
This will download the leaderboard from the official crossfit site. Both male and female leaderboards will be downloaded.
At the moment I only consider the RX leaderboard, though I may add scaled later on.
